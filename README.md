# grentperez – Why I Love You

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
She dragged my heart into the flames
She's pleasure and she's pain
She's more than what I bargained for (Initially
I)
Thought she was sand between my toes
But now she's in my clothes
Shoes, socks, and nose (Oh no, now I'm getting
itchy)
In the winter you're a bright and sunny day
Then you go and turn to rain just when I think
it's safe to play
And that's why I love you (You bring the joy
into the darkness of dismay)
Why I need you (You put the color into boring
shades of gray)
Like August rain into the summer (No one could
ever take your place)
You are the dеssert to my supper (Supper, a flow
еr, the sweetness to my sour)
You bring the light into the darkest of days
And it's complicated, convoluted
No batteries included
When you picture it in your mind
But when she's here everything falls into place
Like a brushstroke in this painting of her and I
(Uh)
And that's why I love you (You bring the joy
into the darkness of dismay)
Why I need you (You put the color into boring
shades of gray)
Like August rain into the summer (No one could
ever take your place)
You are the dessert to my supper (Supper, a
flower)
Why I love you (You bring the joy into the
darkness of dismay)
Why I need you (You put the color into boring
shades of gray)
Like August rain into the summer (No one could
ever take your place)
You are the dessert to my supper (Supper, a
flower, the sweetness to my sour)
You bring the light into the darkest of days
