I found love in you
And have learnt to love me too
Hmmm
Never ever felt that i could be all that you say
It's like our hearts have intertwined into d perfect harmony
This is why i love you{ 2×}
Because you love
You love me
I found love in you
And no other love will do
And every moment that you smile chases all the pain away
Forever and a while in my heart is where you staying

You are so beautiful too me(2)
Can't you see
You are everything i hope for
And you are everything i need

That's why i love you
